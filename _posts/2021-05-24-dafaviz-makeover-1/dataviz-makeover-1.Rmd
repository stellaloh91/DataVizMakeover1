# 1. Original Visualisation

![Figure 1: Original visualisation](Image/originalvisuals.JPG)

### Data Source

The data visualisation above is created by using data provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). 

# 2. Critiques

### 2.1 Clarity

i. **Chart title is not aligned with the chart content**- Title reads as "Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019-2020". However, chart for Japan only reflects 2020 data.

ii. **Chart axis is misleading**- 
    (a) y-axis scale differs across each country's chart. This will mislead users who do not read the graph in detail.
    (b) Charts have dual y-axis for imports and exports. The scales for imports and exports within each country's chart are not synchronized and hence have different ranges. This makes it difficult to compare whether a country is in net export/ import position. This may also be misleading to users who do not read the graph in detail.
  
iii. **Chart did not specify criteria for which top 6 trading partners is chosen.**- Some considerations include:
    (a) Across which period, and
    (b) What is being considered- net trade import/ export or consider each separately?

iv. **Presentation may not be the most appropriate depending on purpose of what the author is trying to show**- 
    (a) Comparing import and export across time for each country, or 
    (b) Comparing net import/ export across time for each country.

v. **No commentary provided**- reader does not have commentary to understand the main idea of the visualisation.

vi. **Does not include data source**- reader is unable to verify the data, nor replicate the chart using source data.

### 2.2 Aesthetics

i. **Different alignments of x-axis**- charts of various thickness makes the entire visualisation look disorganised.

ii. **Chart title vs country name font size**- Font size of title should be larger than the country name.

iii. **Does not specify measurement currency**- reader will not know if figures for each country is measured in the same currency. This can be included in the axis information.

iv. **Annotations are not used to convey points**, leaving the reader to infer the purpose of the graph.

v. **Poor use of colors in the chart**- use of area chart with overlap of colors makes it difficult to read.

vi. **No tick marks for y-axis values** even though it's on a continuous scale.

# 3. Proposed Design

### Sketch
![Figure 2: Sketch of proposed design](Image/proposeddesign.JPG)

### Advantages of proposed design

3.1 Clarity
i. Chart title is aligned with the chart content- chart shows only the relevant periods as aligned with title.

ii. Chart axis is aligned across all 6 countries-
    (a) y-axis scale is aligned across each country's chart.
    (b) Charts have synchronized axis for imports and exports.

iii. Proposed chart shows exports, imports and net exports/imports across time for each country- users are able to identify trends across time for both exports and imports. This also reduces the need for users to manually compute the net export/import.
    
iv. Chart title provides audience with the big picture, followed by short commentary to provide more context.

v. Data source is included in chart.

3.2 Aesthetics

i. x-axis is aligned across each country's chart- this makes the visualisation more organised and allows users to compare the trends across time for each country.

ii. Font size for chart title, commentary and chart annotations have been adjusted so as not to divert reader's attention.

iii. Measurement currency is specified in the axis so reader will know at one glance.

iv. Annotations added to convey points.

v. Colors are consistent throughout the dashboard with clear legend on what they represent. Minimal overlapping of colors.

vi. Tick marks added to y-axis scale. Soft gridlines have also been added to the chart to provide reference but not to distract users.

# 4. Data Visualisation Steps

1. After downloading the data, select data for the relevant countries from each dataset (import and export dataset) and paste into a new sheet using Microsoft Excel.

![Figure 3: Extract relevant data](Image/countrydata.JPG)

2. Transpose the extracted import and export data, naming the date column as "Date" and value column as "Imports"/ "Exports" respectively.

![Figure 4: Transposed data](Image/transposeddata.JPG)

3. Combine the transposed import and export data.

![Figure 5: Combined data](Image/combineddata.JPG)

4. Perform the following actions:

No  |Variable     | Action
----|-------------| ----------------------------------------
1   |Variables    | Rename column as "Country"
2   |Variables    | Removed "(Thousand Dollars)" from value
3   |Imports      | Rename column as "Imports (S$'000)"
4   |Exports      | Rename column as "Exports (S$'000)"

![Figure 6: Rename columns](Image/renamecolumns.JPG)

After the above manipulations have been performed, save the data as "data_clean".


### <Singapore's Trade with top 6 countries> sheet

5. Import the data into Tableau.

![Figure 7: Import data into tableau](Image/importtableau.JPG)

6.Change data type- change Date data type to “Date”.

![Figure 8: Create calculated field](Image/changedatefield.JPG)

7. As we will be presenting the charts for 6 countries in the form of a trellis, we have to create 2 calculated fields called "x-axis" and "y-axis".
    (a) Create a new calculated field and name it "x-axis", with the below formula (figure 8).
    (b) Create another calculated field named "y-axis", with the below formula (figure 9).

![Figure 9: Create calculated field](Image/createcalculatedfield.JPG)
![Figure 10: x-axis formula](Image/x-axis-formula.JPG)
![Figure 11: y-axis formula](Image/y-axis-formula.JPG)

7. Drag [Date] to columns and change selection to month. Change data type to continuous.

![Figure 12: Drag date to columns](Image/datecolumn.JPG)

8. Drag [Exports($'000)] to rows, then drag [Imports($'000)] and drop it into the chart as seen in Figure 13 below. This creates a measure values shelf that appears in the data pane and contains all the measures of the data collected into one field. 

![Figure 13: Drag exports and imports to rows](Image/fillrow.JPG)

9. Drag the calculated fields [x-axis] and [y-axis] to Columns and Rows respectively.Convert both fields into discrete fields.

![Figure 14: Update fields](Image/x-y-axis.JPG)

10.Drag [Country] into the marks card under detail.

![Figure 15: Drag country into detail](Image/addcountry.JPG)

10.Edit table calculation for both [x-axis] and [y-axis] calculated fields.Select computation using specific dimensions- by [Country] then by [Month of Date], at the level of [Country].

![Figure 16: Edit table calculation for x-axis and y-axis fields](Image/x-axis-edit.JPG)

11. Create another calculated field named [Net exports/imports], with the below formula.

![Figure 17: Net export/import calculated field](Image/netexportorimport.JPG)

12. Drag [Net exports/imports] into Rows and select dual axis.Right click on the axis and select synchronize axis (Figure 19).

![Figure 18: Synchronize axis](Image/synchronizeaxis.JPG)

13. On the Marks card for [net exports/imports], click the Mark Type drop-down and select bar.

![Figure 19: Change mark type to bar](Image/editmarkscard.JPG)

14. Drag [net exports/imports] to Color on the Marks. On the Marks card, click Color > Edit Colors.
    (a) Update stepped color option to 2 steps as we want to show negative and positive values in different colors
    (b) Click on the drop down under palette and select the red-green diverging option.
    (c) Adjust the slider under opacity to 50%.

![Figure 20: Change colors](Image/editcolor.JPG)
![Figure 21: Adjust opacity](Image/editopacity.JPG)

15. Now that we have created the trellis, we will move on to add labels to each panel. Drag [Country] into the Measure Values Marks card and drop it into Label.This will label the [Exports] and [Imports] line graph within each panel in the trellis with the countries they are representing.

![Figure 22: Label panels](Image/addcountryintolabel.JPG)

17. Hide the net export/ imports axis on the right by deselecting Show Header.

![Figure 24: Hide](Image/hidetrellisx-axis.JPG)
![Figure 25: Hide](Image/hidetrellisy-axis.JPG)
![Figure 26: Hide field label for columns](Image/hidecolfieldlabel.JPG)

18. As we only need 1 country label, instead of 2 as seen in Figure 22 above, we will proceed to right click on the import line graph label and select Mark Label > Never Show. Now we are left with 1 label for each panel <font size 9>.

![Figure 27: Hide label for import line graph](Image/hidelabel.JPG)

19. Select and move the remaining label to the top left of each panel.

![Figure 28: Align remaining label to top left of each panel](Image/movelabels.JPG)

20. Next, we will amend the y-axis. Right click on y-axis and select Edit Axis. We will edit the y-axis for the following:
    (a) Under the General pane, update range. Select radio button for fixed and amend start and end to -3,000,000 and 8,500,000 respectively.
    (b) Update Title under Axis Titles to "S$'000".
    (c) Under the Tick Marks pane, select radio button for fixed and amend Tick Interval to 2,000,000. 
    
![Figure 29: Update range and title of y-axis](Image/generalpane.JPG) ![Figure 30: Update tick interval of y-axis](Image/tickmarkspane.JPG)  
21. Next, we will amend the x-axis. Right click on x-axis and select Edit Axis. We will edit the x-axis for the following:
    (a) Under the General pane, update range. Select radio button for fixed and amend start and end to 1/12/2018 and 31/1/2021 respectively. This is to provide a small gap at the start and end of each trellis panel. Next, uncheck Show times.
    (b) Update Title under Axis Titles to "Month".
    (c) Under the Tick Marks pane, select radio button for fixed and amend Tick origin to begin at 1/1/2019, and Tick Interval to 6 months.
